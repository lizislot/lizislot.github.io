## 1. Nim Game & Bouton's Theorem (Nim游戏与Bouton解)
- Classic impartial combinatorial game  
- Bouton's solution: a position is losing iff the XOR (binary sum) of pile sizes is 0  
- Keywords: Nim, impartial game, XOR

---

## 2. Partisan Games (偏置游戏)
- Players have different available moves depending on position  
- Examples: Hackenbush, Domineering  
- Keywords: partisan, asymmetric game

---

## 3. Strategies in Player Games (博弈策略)
- Pure strategy vs mixed strategy  
- Best response and dominance  
- Keywords: 策略, 最优反应

---

## 4. Nash Equilibrium (纳什平衡)
- A profile of strategies where no player can benefit by deviating unilaterally  
- Central solution concept in non-cooperative games  
- Keywords: 纳什平衡, 最优策略

---

## 5. Hall’s Marriage Theorem in Hunter’s Game
- Application of Hall’s theorem in bipartite matching to guarantee successful “hunting”  
- Condition: |N(S)| ≥ |S| for every subset S  
- Keywords: Marriage condition, bipartite matching

---

## 6. Multi-player Symmetric Games (多玩家对称博弈)
- Symmetric if payoffs depend only on strategies, not on who plays them  
- Examples: public goods game, congestion games  
- Keywords: symmetric, 多玩家

---

## 7. Potential Games (势博弈)
- A game where changes in individual payoff can be captured by a single potential function  
- Used to prove convergence of dynamics  
- Keywords: potential, convergence

---

## 8. Extensive Form Games & Bayesian Solutions (扩展式博弈与贝叶斯解)
- Extensive form: tree representation of sequential moves  
- Bayesian games: with incomplete information, players have beliefs over types  
- Keywords: extensive form, 贝叶斯博弈

---

## 9. Repeated Games (重复博弈)
- Infinitely or finitely repeated versions of stage games  
- Folk theorem: many equilibria can arise in repeated settings  
- Keywords: repetition, cooperation

---

## 10. Auctions (拍卖)
- First-price, second-price (Vickrey), English, Dutch  
- Revenue equivalence theorem  
- Keywords: 拍卖, 机制设计

---

## 11. Evolutionary Game Theory (演化博弈论)
- Studies strategy dynamics in large populations  
- Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)  
- Applications in biology and economics  
- Keywords: 演化, ESS
