## 1. Definition of a Topological Space
- A topology on a set X is a collection T of subsets of X (open sets) satisfying:
  1. ∅ and X are in T  
  2. Arbitrary unions of sets in T are in T  
  3. Finite intersections of sets in T are in T  
- Keywords: 拓扑空间定义

---

## 2. Basis for a Topology
- A basis B is a collection of open sets such that every open set can be written as a union of elements of B  
- Keywords: 拓扑基

---

## 3. Hausdorff Space
- A topological space is Hausdorff if for every pair of distinct points, there exist disjoint neighborhoods separating them  
- Keywords: Hausdorff 空间

---

## 4. Interior, Closure, Boundary
- Interior: int(A) = largest open set contained in A  
- Closure: cl(A) = smallest closed set containing A  
- Boundary: ∂A = cl(A) \ int(A)  
- Note: int(A ∪ B) ⊄ int(A) ∪ int(B) in general  
- Keywords: 内部, 闭包, 边界

---

## 5. Dense Sets
- A ⊆ X is dense if cl(A) = X  
- Example: ℚ is dense in ℝ  
- Keywords: 稠密

---

## 6. Limit Points
- x is a limit point of A if every neighborhood of x intersects A \ {x}  
- Closure: cl(A) = A ∪ {limit points of A}  
- Keywords: 极限点

---

## 7. Subspace Topology
- If (X, T) is a topological space and Y ⊆ X, the subspace topology on Y is {U ∩ Y : U ∈ T}  
- Keywords: 子空间拓扑

---

## 8. Product Topology
- Given spaces (X, T_X), (Y, T_Y), the product topology on X × Y has basis {U × V : U ∈ T_X, V ∈ T_Y}  
- Keywords: 乘积拓扑

---

## 9. Quotient Topology
- Given a surjective map p : X → Y, the quotient topology on Y is defined as: U ⊆ Y is open ⇔ p^{-1}(U) is open in X  
- Keywords: 商拓扑

---

## 10. Continuity
- f : X → Y is continuous if preimage of every open set in Y is open in X  
- Equivalent: f^{-1}(V) ∈ T_X for all V ∈ T_Y  
- Keywords: 连续性

---

## 11. Homeomorphisms
- A bijective continuous map f : X → Y with continuous inverse f^{-1}  
- Topological equivalence between spaces  
- Keywords: 同胚

---

## 12. Metric Spaces and Metrizability
- A metric d : X × X → ℝ satisfies:  
  1. d(x,y) ≥ 0, =0 iff x=y  
  2. d(x,y) = d(y,x)  
  3. d(x,z) ≤ d(x,y) + d(y,z) (triangle inequality)  
- A topology is metrizable if it comes from some metric  
- Keywords: 度量空间, 可度量化

---

## 13. Connectedness
- A space X is connected if it cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets  
- Example: ℝ is connected, but ℝ \ {0} is not connected  
- Keywords: 连通性

---

## 14. Uniform Convergence Theorem
- If {f_n} → f uniformly on a compact set K, and each f_n is continuous, then f is also continuous  
- Also applies to integration and differentiation under uniform convergence  
- Keywords: 一致收敛定理

---

## 15. Standard Topology and Standard Metric on ℝ^n
- Standard topology on ℝ^n is generated by open balls under Euclidean metric  
- Heine–Borel theorem: A ⊆ ℝ^n is compact ⇔ A is closed and bounded  
- Keywords: 标准拓扑, 标准度量, Heine–Borel 定理
